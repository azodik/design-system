# Enable workspace protocol for pnpm
# This allows packages to reference each other using workspace:*
# When published, pnpm will replace workspace:* with actual versions
# Note: pnpm-specific config options (auto-install-peers, strict-peer-dependencies)
# are set via pnpm config to avoid npm warnings when npm reads this file
